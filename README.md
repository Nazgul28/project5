# Custom WordPress Theme. 
- project 5 RED Academy -  

It's a multi-page website with a blog for a bakery using WordPress as a CMS.

Interesting project, in which I could develop WP skills and also use PHP, HTML, CSS3, JS techniques.

I'd like to highlight that I could see the crucial role of the WP Template Hierarchy throughout my work.

You may see along my code that I achieved the following requirements:

-Include a custom widget plugin to allow business hours to easily be edited in the sidebar by the client;
-Include a widgetized area in the sidebar;
-Properly enqueue CSS and JS files in the theme’s functions.php file;
-Leverage the WP template hierarchy to generate required layouts for the website;
